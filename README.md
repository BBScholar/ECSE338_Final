# Shared Object Viewer

### How to build:
Make sure `make`, `cmake`, and `git` are installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/BBScholar/ECSE338_Final.git 
cd ECSE338_Final 
git submodule init
git pull --recurse-submodules

mkdir build && cd build 
cmake .. 
make 
```

### Description:
This program can gather and display data pertaining to the shared objects being used by every process on the system. 
Data can be displayed in one of two ways:
1. Processes will be displayed with a list of SO files currently being used by that process
2. Shared objects will be displayed with a list of processes that are using that object

Data is displayed in a table, generated by the [libfort library](https://github.com/seleznevae/libfort/tree/develop). `libfort` is a library that generates lightweight tables in C and C++.

PIDs and shared object names should be in increasing order and lexigraphical order respectively. This ordering is handled within the `set` and `map` classes provided by the c++ standard library.
The `unordered_set` and `unordered_map` provide better performance (due to differing implementations from `set` and `map`), but do not order their keys nicely. It was determined that decrease in performance of the sets and maps is worth it in order to eliminate an additional sort later on.


### Usage:
The binary is generated within the `build` directory and is named `shared_info`. It is convenient to pipe the output directly into `less` in order to be able to scroll the output with greater ease. This can also be piped to a file or other programs if need be.

To run with processes as section headers:
```
./shared_info -proc | less
```

Example output:
![Proc Flag Image](https://github.com/BBScholar/ECSE338_Final/blob/table_lib/images/ProcImg.png?raw=true)

To run with shared objects as section headers:
```
./shared_info -obj | less
```

Example output:
![Obj Flag Image](https://github.com/BBScholar/ECSE338_Final/blob/table_lib/images/ObjImg.png?raw=true)

### Possible Issues:
If there is an SO or a process with a particularly long name, the format of the graph is ruined. This can be fixed by increasing the size of terminal or decrease the font size.

Text wrapping just doesn't look nice sometimes. Dynamically wrapping text is hard.

### Possible Future Improvements:
- Ability to print out 1 PID or 1 SO heading at a time.
- Interactive mode (command line interface with commands specific to this application)
