# Shared Object Viewer

### How to build:
Make sure `make`, `cmake`, and `git` are installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/BBScholar/ECSE338_Final.git 
cd ECSE338_Final 
git submodule init

mkdir build && cd build 
cmake .. 
make 
```

### Description:
This program can gather and display data pertaining to the shared objects being used by every process on the system. 
Data can be displayed in one of two ways:
1. Processes will be displayed with a list of SO files currently being used by that process
2. Shared objects will be displayed with a list of processes that are using that object

Data is displayed in a table, generated by the [libfort library](https://github.com/seleznevae/libfort/tree/develop). `libfort` is a library that generates lightweight tables in C and C++.


### Usage:
Binary is generated within the `build` directory. It is convenient to pipe the output directly into `less` in order to be able to scroll the output with greater ease.

To run with processes as section headers:
```
./shared_info -proc | less
```

Example output:
![Proc Flag Image](https://github.com/BBScholar/ECSE338_Final/blob/table_lib/images/ProcImg.png?raw=true)

To run with shared objects as section headers:
```
./shared_info -obj | less
```

Example output:
![Obj Flag Image](https://github.com/BBScholar/ECSE338_Final/blob/table_lib/images/ObjImg.png?raw=true)
